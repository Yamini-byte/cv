  <p>Optimization of the code is often performed at the end of the development stage since it reduces
    readability and adds code that is used to increase the performance.</p>
  <p>There are many important questions that can be formed from the lesser known part of
    the subject like code optimizations and symbol table. Listing down soe of the basic and
    important questions from them-</p><br>
  <hr size="3">
  <ol>
    <li>What is the outcome of the intermediate code generator phase of the compiler.
      In what ways can the code be represented?</li>
    <li>Code optimization is a part of which phase of the compiler-- analysis or syntheis?</li>
    <li>what are the objectives of the compiler optimization process?</li>
    <li>breifly elaborate the types of code optimizations.</li>
    <li>What are the different tyoes of three address codes.</li>
    <li>How can the three address code be represented?</li>
    <li>What is Back Patching?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Answers to the above questions can be given as </p>
  <ol>
    <li>the outcome of the intermediate code generator is mostly the three address code.
      The other way the optimized code can be represented is are broadly
      <ol>
        <li>Linear form
          <ul>
            <li>postfix expressions</li>
            <li>three address code</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>tree form
          <ul>
            <li>syntax tree</li>
            <li>directed acyclic Graph</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li><br>

    <li>The code optimization is the part of syntheis phase of the comiler,which is a
      program transformation technique, which tries to mprove the intermediate code making it consume
      fewer resources(i.r., CPU, Memory) so that faster running machine code will result.
    </li><br>

    <li>The code optimization process should meet the following objectives-
      <ul>
        <li>The optimization must be correct, it must not in any way change the meaning of the program.</li>
        <li>Optimization should increase the speed and performance of the program</li>
        <li>The compilation time must be kept reasonable</li>
        <li>the optimization must no delay the overall compilation process.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>The types of code optimizations can be broadly classified into two types-
      <ul>
        <li>Machine Independed Optimization-Does not involve any CPU registers ot absolute
          memory Locations.</li>
        <li>Machine Dependent Code optimization-done after the target code has been generated and when
          code is transformed according to the target machine architecture.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>x = y op z</li>
        <li>x = op z</li>
        <li>x = y</li>
        <li>Conditional goto- if g goto L</li>
        <li>Unconditional goto- goto L</li>
        <li>A[i] = x and y = A[i]</li>
        <li>x = *p and y = &p</li>
      </ol>
    </li><br>
    <li>
      <ol>
        <li>Quadruples</li>
        <li>Triples</li>
        <li>Indirect triples</li>
      </ol>
    </li><br>
    <li>Backpatching is the activity of filling up unspecified information of labels using appropriate
      semantic actions during the process of code generation. Backpatching is the activity of filling
      up unspecified information of labels using appropriate semantic actions during the process of code
      generation.
